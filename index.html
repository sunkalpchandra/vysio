            <h2>Rebuilding Vision from the Brain Outward</h2>
            <p>
                Vysio is on a mission to restore visual processing in the brain when it's impaired—whether from aging, trauma, or developmental conditions. While most treatments focus on slowing degeneration or helping individuals cope with vision loss, Vysio offers a different approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                The therapy uses non-invasive light-based stimulation—delivered in precisely designed patterns—to gently retrain the brain’s visual pathways. This technique acts like a subtle "wake-up call" for the brain, reactivating regions responsible for sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vysio pairs this visual stimulation with simple visual tasks and monitors brain activity in real-time using EEG headsets. This feedback-driven system adapts to each patient's progress, providing a tailored experience that maximizes the potential for visual recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                By guiding the brain to rewire itself naturally, Vysio aims to restore meaningful visual function and offer renewed hope to those experiencing vision loss.
